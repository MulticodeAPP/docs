# Multicode's use of "sync URLs"

**Sync URLs** are Multicode's way of allowing you to sync your files and assignments with Multicode's internal files without needing to know about how it's being handled internally. Using these allow you to use your own IDs as you see fit, as long as they are unique. You don't need to know a Multicode ID beforehand, and Multicode will dynamically route and sync your content with the appropriate internal file or assignment.
