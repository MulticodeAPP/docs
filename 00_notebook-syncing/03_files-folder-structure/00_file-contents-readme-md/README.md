# File contents (`README.md`)

The `README.md` of a file consists of three sections:
- "sync URL" to the file on Multicode
- title of the file
- (optional) markdown content

**Example**

```markdown
https://multicode.app/n/<your_notebook_id>/sync/file/<your_file_id>

# File title

... (optional) markdown content ...
```

Where:
- `your_notebook_id` = Notebook ID
- `your_file_id` = your unique ID for this file

This link has two functions:
- for you to quickly navigate to the file on Multicode
- for Multicode to identify which file you are talking about
