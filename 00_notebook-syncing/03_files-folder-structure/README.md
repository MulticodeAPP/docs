# Files/folder structure

All files need to be folders, starting with two numbers and a file title, separated by an underscore. The numbers ensure that all files are ordered in the desired way.

**Example**

```
01_introduction
    \-- README.md
02_assignments
    \-- 01_week-1
        \-- README.md
    \-- README.md
```

The file title in the directory is mostly for visually identifying which contents are contained in the directory. Inside of the `README.md`, you can specify a longer/detailed file title which will be used when displayed.
