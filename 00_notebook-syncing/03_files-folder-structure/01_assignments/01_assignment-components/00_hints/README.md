# Hints

All assignments may contain hints, you can add them by creating a `hints` folder and adding hints as separate Markdown files.

**Example**

```
\-- assignments
    \-- 02_named-assignment
        \-- README.md
        \-- hints
            \-- 01.md
            \-- 02_named-hint.md
    \-- ...
```

Hints contain two numbers for ordering, an underscore, and an optional hint title. The ordering numbers are required, as they allow for an optional title.

The Hint file should contain a title for the Hint and Markdown content, detailing the hint.

**Example**

```markdown
# Your Hint Title

The Hint's contents, an explanation with support for Markdown.
